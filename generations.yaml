    description: "The original Chevrolet Colorado replaced the S-10 as Chevrolet's compact/mid-size pickup truck. Developed alongside the GMC Canyon, it was available in regular cab, extended cab, and crew cab configurations with both short and long bed options. Production began in October 2003 for the 2004 model year. Engine choices initially included inline-four and inline-five cylinder options, with a 5.3L V8 added later in the production run. The first-generation Colorado offered improved refinement compared to the S-10 but faced strong competition from the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier. For 2007, the Colorado received a facelift with new engines (2.9L I4 and 3.7L I5) and styling updates. Another significant refresh came for 2009 with a new 5.3L V8 engine (300 HP) and updated interior materials and technology. Production ended in August 2012. Platform: GMT355."

    description: "The third-generation Colorado, which debuted in July 2022 for the 2023 model year, represents a complete redesign based on the GM VSS-T platform (31XX-2). Now exclusively offered with crew cab and single short box configuration. The single powertrain is a 2.7L turbocharged four-cylinder available in two variants (L2R turbo and L3B turbo), producing 237-310 HP depending on configuration. The exterior design is more aggressive and truck-like, with significant styling differences between trims. The interior is thoroughly modernized with a standard 11.3-inch touchscreen and digital instrument cluster. Off-road capability remains a priority, especially in the ZR2 model which features Multimatic DSSV dampers, electronic locking differentials, and increased ground clearance. This generation positions the mid-size Colorado with dimensions and capabilities approaching full-size pickups. Platform: GM VSS-T (31XX-2)."
